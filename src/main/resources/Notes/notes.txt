Maven phases:

  when you run any of the maven goals - all goals prior to the goal you are running are gonna be execute

  in order to execute a phase, each preceding phases must pass.

1. clean - is going to clean the target folder which contains all of the previously build code
2. validate - checks if all the required info is there
3. compile - compile all the java files into bytecode.
4. test - run unit tests
5. package - create packages your project into a desired executable file. in java we have .jar, .war and
added into the target folder
.jar files are used for creating library projects, and backend java apps.
.war files is used to create web apps.
6. install - pushes the jar file from target folder to .m2 to local repo
7. deploy- this phase deploys the final package to a remote repository, making it avaiable to other developers or project
8. verify: runs test against the packaged code. (component test) - but you have to build and write
//compenent tests. it's usally not a common practice to write component tests in dev source code.
